Disclaimers,"Parliamentary Constituency Names follow the EC Map of 1994 (for Peninsular Malaysia, Labuan, and Sabah) and 1987 (for Sarawak). Gerakan association for the Parliamentary Seat of Tanjong is guessed. EC has made mistakes in quantifying the number of candidates losing deposits (Independents - errors found for Sabah, Sarawak, DAP -errors found for Sabah, Sarawak, Labuan and Permatang Pauh (Pulau Pinang) Parliamentary Constituencies, PBS - errors found in Sabah, PAS - errors found in Labuan). EC has not shown the total number of electors for Petra Jaya (Sarawak), Kota Samarahan (Sarawak), Batang Lupar (Sarawak), Kuala Rajang (Sarawak), Sarikei (Sarawak), Kanowit (Sarawak)and Mukah (Sarawak). Almanak keputusan pilihan raya umum : Parlimen & Dewan Undangan Negeri, 1959-1999 publication was used to fill up the remaining electorate count gaps EC Report has a contradictory value for BN total vote for Sarawak is 269756 which impacts the total valid vote and total ballots issued for Sarawak. DAP pulled out Gagasan Rakyat on 25th January 1995 (few months before elections) and opted to maintain cooperation with S46 and remaining members of Gagasan Rakyat. S46 is a member of Gagasan Rakyat and Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah. EC Report had a contradictory total elector count of 77188 voters for Klang Parliamentary Constituency. EC has contradictory values of total electors of Perlis (it claims of an alternate value of 104195), Kelantan( it claims 608401), Penang (634630), Pahang (498221), Selangor (103050), Sabah (646719). 1995_PARLIAMENTARY_CANDIDATE_NOTES file shows which candidates require sex category verification.
