Disclaimers,"DUN Constituency Names follow the EC's Scoresheet results, but the codes for Parliamentary and DUN seats are from Sabah's 2003 Redelineation Report. EC Constituency Maps do not show space between P. and value and N. and value. Pakatan Rakyat was formed after the 2008 elections but there is an electoral pact between PKR, PAS and DAP (however, there were numerous clashes between PRK and DAP. EC has contradictory figures for rejected votes (271 or 273), unreturned votes (1 or 4) and total ballot issued (7713) for DUN Tungku. There are errors in party association found in the information presented by undi.info and the Star website. There are number of candidates who withdrew from the nomination such as Independent Candidate for DUN Senallang (MOHD SAYADI BIN BAKAL), DUN Tanjong Batu (DASUN BIN SUMBIN) and PKR Candidate for DUN Gum-Gum (MUHASPA MOHD HASSAN). 2008_DUN_CANDIDATE_NOTES file shows which candidates require sex category verification.
