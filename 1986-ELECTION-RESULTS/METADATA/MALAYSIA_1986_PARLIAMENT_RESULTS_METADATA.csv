Disclaimers,"EC produced conflicting values of the total electorate for contested constituencies (6791446), total ballot issued (4752006), total rejected votes (126734), and total valid votes (4625272). EC undercounted the total votes of NASMA (10360). New Straits Times 5 August 1986 claims there were only four SNAP and five PBDS candidates. New Straits Times 2 August 1986 states that there are five SNAP candidates. Star 10 August 1986 states there are two HAMIM candidates while New Straits Times 5 August 1986 states there is only one HAMIM candidate. MCA classification for Petaling Jaya requires more verification. EC had a contradictory value of 55416 as the total electorate for Batu Pahat. EC placed a contradictory value on the total electorate of contested constituencies in Johor (767930). EC missed out on placing a Lost deposit status for the PAS candidate (Pontian). Sex categories for Chinese candidates are largely backed up with evidence but caution must be exercised due to certain data limitations. Refer to 1986_PARLIAMENT_CANDIDATE_NOTES for information about the sex category information. EC may have misspelled the PBB Candidate of Samarahan. PAS created the Harakah Keadilan Rakyat Coalition which includes PAS, PRM, Nasma, and SDP however SDP of Perak and Johor chapters pulled out from the Coalition. Constituency Spelling follows the 1984 Peninsular Malaysia EC Map, 1984 Sabah EC Map, and 1977 Sarawak EC Map (with the exception of not following of erroneous spelling of Kanawit). Postal Vote Statistics is derived from Laporan Pilihanraya Umum Malaysia 1986, Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia.
