- Uploaded the Sarawak 1987 DUN Redelineation Impact:
- Notes: EC commenced the 1987 Sarawak Redelineation (which involves 27 parliamentary seats and 56 DUN seats) on 15th March 1986. However, before the redelineation could complete, Sarawak DUN experienced snap dissolution in 1987 of which 48 DUN seats were contested. Hence, in the Sarawak 1987 DUN Redelineation Impact, term 1987 pre Redelineation was used to distinguish electoral constituencies of 1987 Sarawak State Elections with 1987 post redelineated constituencies (using the term 1987). EC Redelineation Report doesn't disclose the list of new parliamentary (except P.155 Santubong) and DUN constituencies (except N.5 Tupong) and name changes (Sebandi, Kuala Rajang).
New Straits Times (22/10/1990) states the new parliamentary seats are Santubong, Batang Lupar and Selangau. Parliamentary Constituencies that experienced name change were Santubong (now Petra Jaya), Samarahan (now Kota Samarahan), Simunjan (now Batang Sadong), Batang Lupar (now Sri Aman), Paloh (now Kuala Rajang), Sibu (now Lanang), Rajang (now Sibu), Ulu Rajang (now Hulu Rajang) and Lambir (now Miri). New Straits Times (September 1991) claims DUN Batu Lintang and Kakus are new seats. Users are to exercise discretion of using this dataset due to contesting interpretations
