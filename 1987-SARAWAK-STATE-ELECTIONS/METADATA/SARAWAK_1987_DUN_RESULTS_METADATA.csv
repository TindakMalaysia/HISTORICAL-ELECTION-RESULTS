Disclaimers,"There are gaps in the age data for the candidates. PBDS is a state-level opposition to BN3 (PBB, SNAP, and SUPP) but remains a member of Barisan Nasional (federally). The 1987 Sarawak elections remain the last state elections to use the 1977 boundaries. PBDS and Permas were in an alliance (Kumpulan Maju). Nyipa Bato could not stand as SUPP candidate as Belaga belongs to PBB. There is missing information on Independent Symbols.
