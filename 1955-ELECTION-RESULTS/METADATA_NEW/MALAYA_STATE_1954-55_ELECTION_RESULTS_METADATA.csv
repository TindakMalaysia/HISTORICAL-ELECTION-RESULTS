Disclaimers,"There may be discrepancies for the age of candidates as there is no official data released for the attribute.There are missing data points for age attribute for candidates and total electors.Unless there is information about candidates losing deposit, most of the state election results do not have records of candidates losing deposit (with some exceptions). For Perak, candidates lost deposit if they win less than one-sixth of the votes cast. Johor Candidates lose deposit if they win less than 1/10 of total votes cast in their constituency.  No clarity whether PMIP and PMIA are referring to same party. State Election Results files are separated as first elections to state legislative councils were done separately from 1954 to 1955. Though some states do not have values of Other Party (2) or multiple Independents, the column headings were standardized so that a user can combine data files into single sheet if they want to.
