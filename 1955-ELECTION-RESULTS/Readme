The 1954-55 elections of Malaya were done separately (both in hierarchy and geography)
The election files for each state and Malaya are separate due to difference in election dates. Johore and Trengganu started their elections to their state legislative asssemblies in 1954, followed by other states
Data for State Elections of Pahang is largely incomplete and hence not uploaded
