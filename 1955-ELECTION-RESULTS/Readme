The 1954-55 elections of Malaya were done separately (both in hierarchy and geography)
The election files for each state and Malaya are separate due to difference in election dates. Johore and Trengganu started their elections to their state legislative asssemblies in 1954, followed by other states
While elections were held separately for states of Malaya, the column headings are standardized to ensure ease of combination of state files
Map file for the 1954 Malayan Electoral Boundaries has been uploaded
Ethnic Composition Data for 1955 Elections for selected seats must be used with caution
