Disclaimers,"Parliamentary Constituency Names follow the EC Map of 2003 (for Peninsular Malaysia, Labuan, and Sabah) and 1996 (for Sarawak). Barisan Alternatif is made up of PAS, PKR and PRM. Dr Kumar is a member of Parti Sosialis Malaysia (then an unregistered party) and contested under PKR ticket. Upon conclusion of voting, Barisan Nasional won 198 seats. It gained one more seat via election petition for Pasir Puteh (Kelantan). The Election Judge ruled that the result by the Returning Officer was null and void, and consequently declared the candidate from Barisan Nasional as the winner. EC has made the mistake of affixing the winning majority for Balik Pulau (claiming it is 12937). EC affixed contradictory vote value of 8177 of PKR candidate of Balik Pulau (Pulau Pinang). EC has affixed a contradictory vote value of 12938 for UMNO candidate of Kuala Kangsar (Perak) and this in turn resulted EC placing contradictory value of 6191 as winning majority for that constituency.  EC affixed DAP status for Fuziah Salleh of Kuantan (Pahang) when the correct association was PKR. This resulted in errorneous values by EC for total PKR and DAP votes for Pahang. EC placed a contradictory value of 9752 for winning majority in Raub (Pahang). According to EC, total rejected vote value of Sarawak was 5972 and this impacted total ballot issue count for Sarawak. EC had a contradictory value of total electors of Pahang (claiming it is 570126 voters). EC affixed PAS tag for Alor Setar (Kedah) candidate for Barisan Alternatif when the candidate was from PKR. This impacted valid vote totals for PKR and PAS for Kedah. EC affixed PAS tag for Kemaman (Terengganu) candidate for Barisan Alternatif when the candidate was from PKR. This affected valid vote totals for PKR and PAS for Terengganu.  Missing independent candidate symbol for Kota Raja (Selangor) Independent Candidate. 2004_PARLIAMENTARY_CANDIDATE_NOTES file shows which candidates require sex category verification.
