Disclaimers,"DUN Constituency Names follow the EC's Scoresheet results. Barisan Alternatif is made up of PAS, PKR, and PRM. The EC Scoresheet wrongly associated Rayner Francis Udong (DUN Bingkor) with DAP. EC affixed errorneous majority value for DUN Likas (claiming it is 3993) and DUN Tanjong Batu (claiming it is 5784). 2004_DUN_CANDIDATE_NOTES file shows which candidates require sex category verification.
