Disclaimers,"According to Diane K Mauzy publication, there are two Berjasa Candidates. According to New Straits Times 7th April 1982, only BERJASA candidate was allocated for Parliamentary level. We took the view of Diane K. Mauzy's data point as the correct count for Berjasa. EC has conflicting information whether the candidate SHAHARUDDIN BIN DAHALAN as PEKEMAS or PSRM.Majority of candidate sex background is backed up with evidences however the accuracy may dip for Chinese descent candidates. Constituency Spelling follows the 1974 Peninsular Malaysia Redelineation Report, 1974 Sabah Redelineation Report and 1977 Sarawak Redelineation Report.
