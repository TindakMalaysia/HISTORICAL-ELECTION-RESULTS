Disclaimers,"According to Diane K Mauzy's publication, there are two Berjasa Candidates. According to the New Straits Times on 7th April 1982, only the BERJASA candidate was allocated to the Parliamentary level. We took the view of Diane K. Mauzy's data point as the correct count for Berjasa. EC has conflicting information on whether the candidate SHAHARUDDIN BIN DAHALAN is PEKEMAS or PSRM.The majority of candidate sex backgrounds are backed up with evidence however the accuracy may dip for Chinese descent candidates. The sex category for SAPO Candidate of Sarikei requires more verification. Constituency Spelling follows the 1974 EC Maps of Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah and 1977 EC Map of Sarawak. Postal Vote Statistics is derived from Penyata Pilihan Raya Umum (Dewan Rakyat dan Dewan Undangan Negeri, Tahun 1982, Suruhanjaya Pilihan Raya.
