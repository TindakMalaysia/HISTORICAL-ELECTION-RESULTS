Disclaimers,"There may be discrepancies for the age of candidates as there is no official data released for the attribute.There are many missing data points for age attribute for candidates. There is a mistake Government Gazette made for the total valid votes of the candidates for DUN Tellian. Though Astro Awani claims only 22 women candidates, there is 23 women candidates for the elections. Due to infighting within Pakatan Harapan, there are few seats where DAP and PKR competed against each other. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the dataset, TindakMalaysia Network Services PLT is not responsible for any errors or omissions arising from the original dataset or its derivatives"
