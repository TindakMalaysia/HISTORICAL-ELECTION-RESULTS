Disclaimers,"All the percentages for electoral demographics are calculated by Tindak Malaysia. Due to severe data deficiency and quality issues in certain public sources (i.e. Elections Lab), all ethnic proportions for every constituency was compared against 2016 Sarawak State Electoral Composition. If source data for a particular ethnic group (i.e. Iban) has percentage difference greater than 5% when compared to 2016 Sarawak State Electoral Composition, N/A is affixed for the said ethnic group. The exception is given for the following constituencies - Batu Lintang, Serembu, Tarat, Mambong, Gedong, Baleh, Lambir, Marudi, Telang Usan and Mulu. For constituencies that have not been given an exception, N/A is affixed for Other for any constituencies of 2021 that had positive difference of Others greater than 1% when compared to 2016 Sarawak State Elections. For cells under the column Orang Ulu that is left blank, it amounts to negligible amount of Orang Ulu voters for the given consituency"
