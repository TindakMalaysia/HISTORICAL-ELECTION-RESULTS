Disclaimers,"This file does not have the candidate's age information. For simplicity purposes, DAP and PAS are classified as Other Party (instead of their umbrella coalitions - Gagasan Rakyat (for DAP) and Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah (for PAS). There is a dispute about the actual figures of women candidates contesting. New Straits Times of 21/2/1994 states there are four but Tindak's research states there are five candidate. There is a discrepancy of total electors for the Sabah 1994 elections where EC states that it is 598312 voters when Tindak's tally is 598305 voters. EC has placed errorneous turnout value for Bengkoka as it the value should be 69.82%. New Straits Times (20/2/1994) has errorneously states 52 candidates lost deposit where actual EC's reported count is 53.
