Disclaimers,"No Information was available for Symbols used by Independents. There are conflicting interpretations of the existing Sarawak Alliance. According to 1969 Election Report by EC, Parties of Bumiputera and SCA (Sarawak) were counted as Alliance in general. While PESAKA joined Sarawak Alliance in 1962, its status for 1969 general elections is not clear (as it competed against Bumiputera and SCA). There was competition among PESAKA candidates. Gerakan and DAP had an informal pact during the 1969 elections and hence they are grouped in Other Party (2). EC may have missed out affixing lost deposit for PMIP Candidate of DUN Ayer Tawar (Perak). EC has made errors for total valid votes for Independents of Perak. EC has made errors on total electors of Selangor and Trengganu. EC has made errors for winning majority for DUN Sura and DUN Chukai (Trengganu). EC also has made errors for DUN Saribas and DUN Telang Usan (Sarawak). There is no clear defintion found who lose deposits.
