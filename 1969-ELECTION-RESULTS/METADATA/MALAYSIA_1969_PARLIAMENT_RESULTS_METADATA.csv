Disclaimers,"There are conflicting information on existence and what constitutes Sabah Alliance. According to SPR Sabah office, Sabah Alliance was treated as state government and USNO/SCA as opposition parties. National Archives treats as though 10 or so seats won uncontested by USNO as part of Alliance. According to Agus Yusoff, Sabah Alliance of post 1967 includes USNO. There are conflicting interpretations of the existing Sarawak Alliance. According to 1969 Election Report by EC, Parties of Bumiputera and SCA (Sarawak) were counted as Alliance in general. While PESAKA joined Sarawak Alliance in 1962, its status for 1969 general elections is not clear (as it competed against Bumiputera and SCA). Gerakan and DAP had an informal pact during the 1969 elections and hence they are grouped in Other Party (1). EC is known to place contradictory values for selected candidate votes, rejected votes and total electors. This affected Lipis PAS Candidate, Total Electors of Port Dickson, Total Electors of Batu (EC claiming there is 50181 voters), Total Electors of Selangor State and few other places. There is no clear defintion found who lose deposits.  According to Federal Gazette 1969, there was an independent Candidate by the name Limbai bin Angkapon (Independent - Shoe) in Tuaran. However, the seat was viewed uncontested. EC errorneously claimed that there were 287 candidates from political parties (actual number is 306) and 35 independent candidates (actual number is 34).
