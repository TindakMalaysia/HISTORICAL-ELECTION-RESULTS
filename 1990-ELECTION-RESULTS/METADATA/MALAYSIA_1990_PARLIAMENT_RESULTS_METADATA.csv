Disclaimers,"Parliamentary Constituency Names follow the EC Map of 1984 (for Peninsular Malaysia, Labuan, and Sabah) and of 1987 (for Sarawak). Government Gazette P.U. (B) 730 29/11/1990 erroneously placed 939 as the winning majority for Baram (Sarawak). Government Gazette P.U. (B) 730 29/11/1990 has an alternate spelling for PBB candidate (Wahab Suhaili). PBS used to be part of Barisan Nasional but quit Barisan Nasional after nomination day (15/10/1990) and joined Gagasan Rakyat. As PBS joined after the nomination day and would clash with DAP of GR coalition, PBS is parked under Other Party (1). S46 belongs to Gagasan Rakyat (GR) and Angkatan Perpaduan Ummah (APU) and hence, it was given a separate column. Parties for GR are S46, DAP, PRM, PBS, MSP and AMIPF. Parties for APU are S46, PAS, HAMIM, KIMMA and Berjasa. EC has made errors for calculating total ballots issued for Kedah (claiming it is 500675 votes). EC has conflicting information of Independent Candidates of Kelantan of losing deposits. EC has conflicting information of unreturned votes of 567 and 569 for Tasek Gelugor (Penang). EC has made errorneous or contradictory values for total ballots issued for Pulai (Johor). EC has made errorneous total valid votes for DAP in Sarawak. 1990_PARLIAMENTARY_CANDIDATE_NOTES file show which candidates require sex category verification.
