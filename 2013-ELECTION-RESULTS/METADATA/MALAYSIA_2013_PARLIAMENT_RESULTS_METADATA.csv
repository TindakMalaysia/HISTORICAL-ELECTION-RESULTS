Disclaimers,"Candidate Age data will be added at a later stage. Even though Pakatan Rakyat is composed of PAS, PKR, and DAP, there was one seat where Pakatan Rakyat parties clashed. Michael Jeyakumar Devaraj is a PSM member who contested under PKR ticket for Sungai Siput. All Candidate Names were updated to reflect Gazette names. Even though there was no redelineation exercise between 2003 - 18 for Peninsular Malaysia, Labuan, and Sabah and from 2015 for Sarawak, EC has adopted a different Parliamentary Constituency Code numbering for the 2013 Elections. Corrections were made for the party association of N.Gobalkrishnan (Batu Kawan) and Zulkifli Noordin (Shah Alam). Spelling for Kulim - Bandar Baharu was fixed.
