Disclaimers,"EC made mistake for DAP Candidate Valid Vote Value for Loh Poh Seng (EC claims it is 11060). Status of R.C.M.Rayan as Independent for Sungai Siput is debateable as R.C.M Rayan was PPP candidate in Ipoh. EC made mistakes for Total Ballots Issued for Kuala Terengganu (EC claims it is 22476),Ulu Trengganu (EC Claims it is 18145) and Ulu Nerus (EC Claims it is 18123). EC has conflicting information whether the candidate Mohd. Nawawi bin Haji Mohd. Hassan as Independent and KITA.
