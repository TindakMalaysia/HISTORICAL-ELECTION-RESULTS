Disclaimers,"There are missing gaps for candidates' age data. EC made mistake for DAP Candidate Valid Vote Value for Loh Poh Seng (EC claims it is 11060). Status of R.C.M.Rayan as Independent for Sungai Siput is debateable as R.C.M Rayan was PPP candidate in Ipoh. EC made mistakes for Total Ballots Issued for Kuala Terengganu (EC claims it is 22476),Ulu Trengganu (EC Claims it is 18145) and Ulu Nerus (EC Claims it is 18123). EC has conflicting information whether the candidate Mohd. Nawawi bin Haji Mohd. Hassan as Independent and KITA. There is conflicting information on the party affliation of DAP candidate of Goh Hock Guan of Sungai Nibong as there is a Gerakan Candidate who bears the same name who contested in Petaling in the same year. PSRM lost deposits for 9 constituencies according to EC report. However, there is no evidence of any Trengganu PSRM candidate lost deposit. EC has contradictory value who and number of PEKEMAS candidates lost deposit. EC has contradictory value the number of Independents in Perak losing deposit. There is conflicting information on the party affliation of Osman bin Abu Bakar as similar named candidate contested as K.I.T.A. Parliamentary Candidate. EC may not have accurate values for Total Ballots Issued, Total Rejected Votes, Total Valid Votes, DAP, KITA, Independents. EC states that 1974 Total Voter Count of Pulai has two values - 34344 and 34345. EC does not have accurate total count of electors of Johor (claiming it is 495400). PBB allocation for Parliamentary Seats of Batang Lupar, Julau and Baram are guestimated.
