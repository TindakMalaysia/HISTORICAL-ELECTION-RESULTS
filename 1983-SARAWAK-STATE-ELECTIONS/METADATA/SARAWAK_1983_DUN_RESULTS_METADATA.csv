Disclaimers,"There are gaps in the age data for the candidates. SNAP is part of the BN government, but for this election, it is treated as a separate entity. PBDS (breakaway of SNAP)attempted to join BN before the elections but was blocked by a veto from SNAP. SNAP and PBDS contested under their banner and not using the BN banner, Taib Mahmud, then Chief Minister, formulated BN Plus government which includes BN (PBB, SUPP, SNAP) and PBDS. Independents won for this election were aligned to certain political parties (for Bengoh, aligned to PBB, Engkilili and Dudong Independent winners aligned to SUPP and for Tatau, initially contested as independent, later supported PBDS).
