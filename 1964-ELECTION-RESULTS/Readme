1964 and 1969 Parliamentary and State Constituency Codes are based on the interpretation of the maps found in the respective election reports. Though no redelineation was done from 1958 till 1974 (barring the annulled 1960 and 1973 redelineation exercises), there is mismatch of codes of 1964 and 1969 with 1959 elections
